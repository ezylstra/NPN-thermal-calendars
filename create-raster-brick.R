# Explored mean, SD, and year count rasters in count-years-exploration.R
# Upshot is that there can be 5 types of cells in rasters:
# mean = NA, SD = NA, count = 0: outside area of interest 
# mean = Inf, SD = NA, count = 0: cell reached threshold in 0 years
# mean = value, SD = NA, count = 1: cell reached threshold in 1 year
# mean = value, SD = 0, count > 1: cell reached same threshold every year it was reached
# mean = value, SD = value, count > 1: cells reached different thresholds multiple years

# Create RasterBrick for each threshold, convert mean = Inf to mean = NA and 
# convert cells in mean raster to NA when the threshold wasn't reached in at 
# least X (min_years) years

# Commented code in loop below can be used to double-check that the raster
# cell conversions were done correctly
